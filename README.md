# FrenchExDev.Net.FiniteStateMachine.Core

A tiny & flexible, enum-typed generic Finite State Machine library for .NET, written in C#.
This library enables you to separate modeling and building of executable stateful workflows, with support for custom actions, conditions, and transition-specific behaviors.

---

## Features

- **Strongly-typed FSMs**: Use your own types for states, triggers, and context objects.
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent API for defining states, transitions, and actions.
- **Transition Actions & Conditions**: Attach logic and guards to transitions.
- **State Entry Actions**: Execute logic when entering a state.
- **Unit-tested**: Includes comprehensive tests using a typical FSM scenario.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install

```powershell
dotnet add package FrenchExDev.Net.FiniteStateMachine.Core
```

### 2. Create a Class

Create a class that will represent the context of your state machine:

```csharp
class Door
{
    public bool Locked { get; set; }
    public void History(DeviceState state, DeviceEvent trigger, DateTime timestamp){ /* ... */ }
    public void ResetAvailableOperations(DeviceOperation[] operations) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 3. Define Your Events and States

Define enums or classes for your states and triggers:

```csharp
enum DoorState { Closed, Open, Locked }
enum DoorEvent { Open, Close, Lock, Unlock }
```

### 4. Build a State Machine

Use the builder to define states and transitions:

```csharp
using FrenchExDev.Net.FiniteStateMachine.Core;

var builder = new FiniteStateMachineBuilder<Door, DoorState, DoorEvent>();

builder
    .Transition(fromState: DoorState.Closed, toState: DoorState.Open, on: DoorEvent.Open)
    .Transition(fromState: DoorState.Open, toState: DoorState.Closed, on: DoorEvent.Close, body: (door, e, fsm) => {
        door.Locked = true;
    })
    .Transition(fromState: DoorState.Closed, toState: DoorState.Locked, on: DoorEvent.Lock)
    .Transition(fromState: DoorState.Locked, toState: DoorState.Closed, on: DoorEvent.Unlock, body: (door, e, fsm) =>
    {
        door.Locked = false;
    });

var door = new Door();
var fsm = builder.Build(door, DoorState.Closed);
```

### 5. Fire triggers

```csharp
fsm.Fire(DoorEvent.Open);   // Door transitions to Open, returned TransitionResult.Success
fsm.Fire(DoorEvent.Close);  // Door transitions to Closed, returned TransitionResult.Success
fsm.Fire(DoorEvent.Lock);   // Door transitions to Locked, sets door.Locked = true, returned TransitionResult.Success
fsm.Fire(DoorEvent.Unlock); // Door transitions to Closed, sets door.Locked = false, returned TransitionResult.Success
```

# Advanced: State Entry Actions

imagine the following scenarios:

```csharp
using FrenchExDev.Net.FiniteStateMachine.Core;

public class Device {
    public Device History(DeviceState state, DeviceEvent trigger, DateTime timestamp) { /* ... */ }
    public Device ResetAvailableOperations(DeviceOperation[] operations) { /* ... */ }
}

public enum DeviceState { NotInitialized, Initing, Available, Connected }
public enum DeviceEvent { Init, Inited, Connect }

```

You can use the `WhenFiniteStateMachineBuilder` to define actions that run 

* when a specific trigger is fired using `.On(DeviceEvent trigger, Action<Device, DeviceEvent, WhenFiniteStateMachine<Device, DeviceState, DeviceEvent>> action);`
* whenever a state is entered, regardless of the trigger using `.When(DeviceState state, Action<Device, DeviceEvent, WhenFiniteStateMachine<Device, DeviceState, DeviceEvent>> action).);`

```csharp
using FrenchExDev.Net.FiniteStateMachine.Core;

var builder = new WhenFiniteStateMachineBuilder<Device, DeviceState, DeviceEvent>();

builder
    .On(DeviceEvent.Open, (device, trigger, fsm) =>     {
        device.History(DeviceState.Open, trigger, DateTime.UtcNow);
    })
    .When(DeviceState.Connected, (device, trigger, fsm) =>
    {
        device.ResetAvailableOperations(new[] { DeviceOperation.Disconnect, DeviceOperation.Upload });
    });

builder
    .Transition(on: DeviceEvent.Init, fromState: DeviceState.NotInitialized, toState: DeviceState.Initing, body: (device, e, fsm) =>
    {
        device.History(DeviceState.Initing, e, DateTime.UtcNow);
        fsm.Fire(DeviceEvent.Inited);
    })
    .Transition(on: DeviceEvent.Inited, fromState: DeviceState.Initing, toState: DeviceState.Available, body: (device, e, fsm) =>
    {
        device.History(DeviceState.Available, e, DateTime.UtcNow);
    })
    .Transition(on: DeviceEvent.Connect, fromState: DeviceState.Available, toState: DeviceState.Connected, body: (device, e, fsm) =>
    {
        device.History(DeviceState.Connected, e, DateTime.UtcNow);
    });

var device = new Device();
var fsm = builder.Build(device, DeviceState.NotInitialized);

fsm.Fire(DeviceEvent.Init);    // Device transitions to Initing, then to Available, returned TransitionResult.Success
fsm.Fire(DeviceEvent.Connect); // Device transitions to Connected, returned TransitionResult.Success
```
